#Hyperparameter optimisation framework

#Requirements

	#Dispatch n workers to train a model with a set of hyperparameters for a number of iterations t.

	#Information to worker can process:
							Hyperparameters:
								model:
									topology connections
								Optimiser:
									lr
									reg
									args
							Epochs
							Weights*
							Data
							ID


	#Return information from trained model:
					#		Hyperparameters
					#		Model Weights
					#		Training Loss
					#		Training time
					#		ID

#Pack and unpack hyperparameters
